# python-tuner
Minimal command-line guitar/ukulele tuner in Python. 
Writeup at <https://mzucker.github.io/2016/08/07/ukulele-tuner.html>

To run:

```python
python tuner.py

```

...then pluck the strings!

This is a fork of the original [Python tuner by Matt Zucker](https://github.com/mzucker/python-tuner)

I've updated it for compatibility with Python 3 and I'm going to be adding some more features when I can. 
Features I'm hoping to add

1. GUI
2. Replace PyAudio 
3. Line picker
4. Multiple tunings
